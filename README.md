; boundaries!! ,, [TW] !! PLEASE READ !!
--/- antitherians / antifurries , proshippers / comshippers DNI! (look them up if you don't know what they mean)
--/- j x uzi, v x uzi, n x thad, and n x j shippers DNI please :3 (you can ship who you want but those make me uncomfortable ^^)
--/- airy x ANYONE shippers DNI 😭
--/- i don't like $3xu4l or explicit jokes
--/- please don't ask for my discord until we get to know each other a bit.. it's happened a couple times that ppl give me their dc then we just stop talking 'cause we're not really "friends"
--/- i can be a bit of a pushover or trust too easily but please don't take advantage of me. i know there might be a bad person reading this but the most i can do is just as you to not..
--/- back on the trust thing, i might tell you too much.. erm.. so like, sorry 😭 you can ask me to stop talking if you want just like try to be nice about it lol
--/- I DO NOT ROLEPLAY NO MATTER WHAT. if i do ever roleplay it's barely 😭 so please don't try to roleplay with me
--/- feel free to hide behind/cuddle me in game + kisses are fine with me :3
--/- i don't like swearing but i won't restrict you from doing that
--/- please add a friend note for me so you don't forget who i am! i recommend adding a date and some information, like pronouns n' stuff :]
--/- please try not to tease me too hard, i know i sound like a wimp but i am sensetive ToT, calling me silly names or just messin' around's ok as long as you don't go to far
--/- [TW!] if you're going through something like $H/$u1cid4l thoughts, i'm not the person to talk to, i'm just a kid. i can try my best to comfort you but please call 9-8-8 or talk to a  therapist. more people love you than you think, including me! <3 it isn't worth it to die so young. you would miss out on so much.. the best advice i can give is to think of the good things every time you have those thoughts. like, your favorite food, your friends (if you have any and if they are good), your favorite show/movie or your pet if you have one.. []
please don't call me baby or any other pet names (pookie + bbg are fine as long as it's platonic/joking)
--/- please use tone indicators!! (look them up if you don't know)
--/- remember. just because we're on each others' friends lists doesn't mean we're friends (respectfully, of course) :]
--/- if you make me uncomfortable i have the right to unfriend/block you. same goes for you! we can talk it out, too, or not if you aren't comfortable.
--/- ⚠️ ; I am under 18. DNI if you are 20+ years old. /srs

--/- i think that's all for now, but i'll add more if i want to! have a good day/night, i'll catch you on the flip side! B)
